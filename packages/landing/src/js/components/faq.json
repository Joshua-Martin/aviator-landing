    "question": "What is Aviator?",
    "answer": "Aviator is an AI avatar that embeds on your website to deliver live, interactive product demos 24/7. Instead of static videos or scheduling calls, prospects can click and explore your actual product interface while Aviator explains features, answers questions, and guides them through real use cases in real-time."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is this different from demo videos or screen recordings?",
    "answer": "Unlike static videos, Aviator is like having an infinitely scalable sales rep. The AI avatar gives personalized demos that match exactly how each prospect would use your product, even customizing mock data to reflect their industry. Aviator asks qualifying questions, adapts the demo in real-time, and captures everything for your sales team. The real value: prospects get a high-quality, personalized demo instantly when they're most interested, giving you a competitive edge by being first to show your product."
  },
  {
    "question": "How quickly can we get Aviator set up?",
    "answer": "You can be up and running in as little as a few hours! It's completely self-serve: sign up, use our browser extension to capture your web app, and record yourself giving a demo (with mic on) so the AI learns your presentation style. Then edit the captured demo to your liking and deploy it anywhere with a simple script tag. Setup time depends on your product's complexity, but most teams can be live within a day."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of results should we expect?",
    "answer": "You can expect to see 50% larger deals, 2x more deals, and 30% faster sales cycles with interactive demos compared to your current demo process."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does Aviator integrate with our sales process?",
    "answer": "Aviator connects with popular CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot), scheduling tools (Calendly), and communication platforms (Slack). All prospect interactions flow directly into your existing workflow, and your sales team gets rich context about what each prospect explored before follow-up calls."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is our product data secure?",
    "answer": "Yes. Aviator uses controlled demo environments, not your live product. You decide exactly what prospects can see and interact with, ensuring sensitive data and features remain protected while keeping the experience realistic. We're also SOC 2 ready for enterprise compliance requirements."
