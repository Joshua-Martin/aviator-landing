  <h1>Aviator: AI Avatars for Interactive Product Demos</h1>
  
  <p>
    Demos can be embedded into landing pages, product tours, or onboarding flows. Visitors can watch the avatar guide them through real product functionality—no code required.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Capabilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Interactive DOM Control:</strong> Avatar has the ability to control the demo via DOM actions, showing features and specific use cases that are actually useful to clients. These are not static demos.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Higher Conversion Rates:</strong> No call scheduled to call attended drop off—Aviator is always ready to do a demo, 24/7.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Poised to Sell:</strong> Aviator does more than show features. It knows your best selling strategies and funnels, and encourages users into the sales funnel that fits their persona—whether encouraging a free trial or booking a call to talk to a human about pricing.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Full Product Knowledge:</strong> With access to customer-specified knowledge base—upload your docs, sales scripts, and feature descriptions—Aviator becomes as knowledgeable as your most seasoned sales rep.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Built-in Guardrails:</strong> Demos are done with a captured Mock app that you can edit after the fact to ensure Aviator shows prospects exactly what you want them to see (and not what you don't).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Stack Integration:</strong> Aviator updates your CRM, sends follow-up emails, books calls with humans as needed, and can even message you on Slack under conditions you set.
    </li>
  </ul>
