  <h1>Aviator: AI Avatars for Interactive Product Demos</h1>

  <p>
    Aviator is an AI avatar that can deliver live, interactive product demos directly on your website. 
    Prospects can see your product in action and interact with the demo without waiting for a scheduled call. 
    Aviator is always available, scales to any volume, and integrates with your sales process.
  </p>

  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Embedded Demos:</strong> Add Aviator to landing pages, onboarding flows, or product tours. 
      Visitors can start a demo instantly without installing anything or booking a meeting.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Interactive DOM Control:</strong> Aviator controls a captured version of your productâ€™s interface 
      to show features, use cases, and workflows. This is not a static video; every step can be personalized to the visitor.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Knowledge-Driven:</strong> Upload your documentation, sales scripts, and feature descriptions. 
      Aviator can answer questions and explain your product as well as an experienced sales rep.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Guardrails and Editing:</strong> Demos run in a controlled environment where you decide exactly 
      what prospects see, protecting sensitive data while keeping the experience realistic.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Sales Workflow Integration:</strong> Aviator can capture leads, update your CRM, 
      send follow-up emails, book calls with human reps, and notify your team in Slack.

    flows seamlessly into your existing workflow:

      <strong>Communication Tools:</strong> Send personalized follow-up emails through Gmail and Outlook 
      based on demo topics discussed. Notify your sales team instantly via Slack when high-intent prospects complete demos.

      <strong>Meeting Scheduling:</strong> Seamlessly book follow-up calls through Calendly integration, 
      allowing interested prospects to schedule time with human reps directly from the demo experience.

      <strong>Data Organization:</strong> Log demo insights, conversation topics, and prospect interests
